This is my first repository - just getting familiar with github

What up people! After 4 years working for a cloud computing company and talking to countless developers about accessing our SDKs and API documentation through Github, I thought it was about time I actually created an account and began to learn how to use it. This is step 1 in my (perhaps foolish) attempt to learn how to code, beginning with HTML and CSS.
